      <p class="lead">The story of Zürich as a history of immigration</p>
      <hr class="my-4">
      <div class="paragraphs">
        <p class="paragraph part1">When Zürich developed into a metropolis at the turn of the 20th century due to
          <strong>industrialization</strong> and consequent rural depopulation, immigrants played a major role in construction. Hence,
          by the year 1912 immigrants represented
          <strong>34.2%</strong> of Zurich’s population.</p>
        <p class="paragraph part2">During
          <strong>World War I and II</strong> many of these immigrants left Zurich again, because men were conscripted for armed
          service in their home countries. The weak economy and restrictive asylum politics after World War I did the rest.
          1945, at the end of World War II foreign resident population in Zurich amounted to only
          <strong>6.8%</strong>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph part3">Since the Swiss industry and infrastructure survived World War II relatively intact, the economic boom in the 50’s
          lead to a turnaround. Due to the increased demand of working force more immigrants moved to Zurich again. Entire
          neighborhoods transformed into multicultural melting pots. In the 50’s many working immigrants came from Italy
          and by
          <strong>1970</strong> almost
          <strong>every second immigrant hold an Italian passport</strong> .</p>
        <p class="paragraph part4">In the following decades immigration remained at high levels and the higher birth rate of immigrant women compared
          to Swiss women contributed to a growing percentage of foreign resident population in Zurich. In the
          <strong>80’s</strong> and
          <strong>90’s</strong> the civil wars in
          <strong>Sri Lanka</strong> and
          <strong>Ex-Yugoslavia</strong> caused many families to flee to Zurich.</p>
        <p class="paragraph part5">Nowadays, immigrants of
          <strong>171 different nationalities</strong> make up
          <strong>32.4%</strong> of Zurich’s resident population, most of them originating from European countries. Since the entry
          into force of the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons in 2002, increasingly single individuals with a higher
          level of education from EU/EFTA member states moved to Zurich for work purposes. German citizens currently represent
          almost a quarter of the foreign resident population. Contrary to frequent assumptions asylum seekers only represent
          a very small percentage of the foreign resident population of Zurich.</p>
